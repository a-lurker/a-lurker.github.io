The plugins listed here are available via the Alternative App Store. The app store becomes accessible via a new menu item in the Alternative User Interface once configured.

Both the Alternative User Interface (AltUI) and AltAppStore (AltAppStore) plugins need to be installed on Vera to access the store. With openLuup; this is all "automatically" set up and ready to go as part of the openLuup suite.

The Alternative App Store can be found [here](https://github.com/akbooer/AltAppStore).

Publishing a plugin in the store is pretty easy. First your plugin code must be available in GitHub. Publish it, using the Publish command in the AltAppStore web page. You need to enter the salient information and it's ready to go.

Plugin icons can be stored on GitHub eg [like so](https://github.com/a-lurker/a-lurker.github.io/tree/master/icons). After a "few days" the raw json describing the plugin appears [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akbooer/AltAppStore/data/J_AltAppStore.json).

Vera 3 users should note the store will not work, as Vera 3 doesn't have the https capability required to access GitHub. However, the apps can always be downloaded from GitHub and manually installed.

For those just interested in what the store contains; refer to the list below - as of 2021 July 27 there were about 75 plugins available:
